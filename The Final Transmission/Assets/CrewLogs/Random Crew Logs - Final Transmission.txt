Random Crew Logs - Final Transmission

CREW LOG #037 — Logistics Officer Mei Tran
Timestamp: 03:12:19
Location: Cargo Bay 1

"Who keeps leaving their tools on crate 27B? I’ve asked twice already — if you lose gear, it doesn't grow legs and walk off. Tag it or lose it. Simple."

"Also, reminder: the lift calibration is off by 0.04 degrees again. Filing another maintenance request."

CREW LOG #051 — Chef Omar Patel
Timestamp: 12:47:53
Location: Galley Terminal

"Inventory says we’re out of hydroponic basil again. That’s the third time this week.

I’m not saying someone’s hoarding it, but whoever keeps adding it to the protein trays like it’s seasoning — stop. You’re ruining the ratios."

"Also, today’s morale meal: mock-chicken teriyaki. Enjoy."

CREW LOG #072 — Ensign Lira N’Kosi
Timestamp: 20:22:01
Location: Observation Deck

"Watched Jupiter crest the edge of the viewport today. Still blows my mind, even after all these jumps.

Feels like the ship hums quieter during these moments. Or maybe that’s just me."

CREW LOG #058 — Systems Tech Bryce Eldin
Timestamp: 09:00:00
Location: Subdeck Maintenance Panel 3

"Ran diagnostics on the sanitation loop. Again. It’s within spec but the smell’s still off. Filter degradation, maybe.

Also noticed a power dip on Subdeck C. Not critical, but logging it for reference."

CREW LOG #081 — Botanist Hyejin Park
Timestamp: 15:34:42
Location: Arboretum Terminal

"The moss sample from Habitat Pod 6 is reacting to light differently than expected. Nothing dramatic — just a slower curve on photosensitivity.

Might be worth adjusting the cycle next week. Also, someone overwatered the peace lilies again."
